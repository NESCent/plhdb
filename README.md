Primate Life Histories Database
===============================

Introduction
------------

Primate Life Histories is an online database project with database and
web interface to archive, manage, search and download individual-based
life history data that have been collected from wild primate populations.

Installation:

1. check out source code to a desired location
2. Install required jar files (see Technology)
3. Create a postgresql database by running the sql scripts under the
   src/db.sql folder in the folliwng order
    1. create tables, including:
        * plhdb.ddl.sql: create major tables to hold scientific data
        * plhdb.audit.sql: create table to store audit information 
        * plhdb.auth.sql: create auth schema with tables to store user
          and authentication and authorization information
    2. create views: plhdb.views.sql
    3. install the SQL procedural language if it is not already
       avalable: `CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;`
    4. create table: plhdb.bulkimp.sql: tables for bulk data import
    5. create functions:plhdb.funcs.sql
    6. create rules: plhdb.rules.sql
    7. initialize data: import cvterm data in the file
       `src/db/data/event_types.txt` with term relationship defined in
       `src/db/data/cvterms.ttl`
4. Create a user with access to the database
5. Compile java classes and generate web application war file.  The
   web-application is built using Apache Ant. You must have ant
   installed in order to build it.

   Properties need to be specified with the '-D' option:
	* `project.version`: the application version
	* `hibernate.database`: the hibernate database URL 
	* `hibernate.username`: the hibernate database user name
	* `hibernate.password`: the hibernate database password 

	Use the database user account you created in step 4.
6. Copy the war file generated in step 5 to Tomcat or Jboss deploy folder
7. Start Tomcat (restart is not necessary for Jboss)
8. The web application should be visible now at
   http://your.domain.name:8080/plhdb
