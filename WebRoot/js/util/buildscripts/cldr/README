The contents of dojo/cldr/nls are generated by these build scripts.  Dojo ships with a
small set of locales by default.  See dojo/cldr/README for details.

To trigger generation of a full set of locale resources, simply type "ant".  An optional
list of locales may be specified as an ant property to limit the locales built.
Currencies may also be specified, but a default list is included in the ant script.

NOTE: it is currently necessary to perform a one-time installation of the Saxon XSLT 
  processor due to classpath issues and workarounds.  Copy the XSLT jars into the
  .ant directory, beneath your home directory:

  util/buildscripts/cldr/lib/saxon8.jar -> ~/.ant/lib
  util/buildscripts/cldr/lib/resolver.jar -> ~/.ant/lib
