<h2>Primate Life Histories</h2>
A NESCent Working Group</br>

<p>Primates are highly charismatic and often serve as flagship species in conservation efforts. 
They are also the closest living relatives of humans, and therefore hold the keys to resolving many 
questions about human evolution and ecology. However, the slow life histories of primates, combined with 
their complex social systems, their behavioral plasticity, and the challenging field conditions in which 
primate researchers must work, have severely limited analyses of mortality and fertility in wild, unprovisioned 
primate populations. This in turn limits comparative analyses that can shed light on the population dynamics and 
the social and ecological adaptations that have shaped both human and nonhuman primate evolution. We propose a Primate 
Life Histories Working Group to compare mortality and fertility schedules across taxa, to evaluate a set of hypotheses 
about the roles that phylogeny, ecology, and behavior play in shaping primate mortality and fertility patterns, and to examine 
whether life history theory predicts which vital rates are most variable across species. Using unique, individual-based life 
history data that have been collected from wild populations by nine working group participants over a minimum of 19 years, 
we will develop age-specific mortality and fertility schedules and create population projection matrices for each species. 
Our immediate goals are to test current hypotheses about the evolution of life histories in order to advance our understanding of 
primate evolution. Our longer-term goal is to move toward a collaborative, shared databank allowing analyses of irreplaceable life history data on wild primates.</p>
